    "For this assignment, we decide to do something with supervised machine learning. Specifically, using a Support Vector Machine modeled on words. Having a massive data set of 3.5 million rows of headlines from the New York Times from years 1980 -to 2016, collected using the NYTimes archive API. We wondered with this much data would it be possible to be able to predict years solely on the headline of the article. The intuition being that important events that shape a year or era will usually be important enough to be reported on in a newspaper headline. For example, we don’t expect headlines of the Soviet Union’s fall to be found in the headlines of the 2000’s and above. Thus, the following cells below show our undertaking and commentary of this exploratory analysis. We will discuss our finding at the very end. "

    "3.5 million rows of data are a doubled edged sword. In loading this up to Juypter Notebook, there were a slew of NA’s and empty sections in rows in our data. This occurred because the archive API does not include information such as what sections was an article published in for older headlines. While later rows ($2000$’s and above) did include whether a article was published in the arts, business section etc.  Thus, in loading them we converted these empty sections into $NA$’s as they would be easier to filter out later."

    "Another issue that cropped up in our Exploratory analysis was the labeling of our data. The years 2015 and 2016 were not as rich as the years before it, thus we omitted those years so as to not mess with our Linear Support Vector Classifier. Another issue was that having all the years from $1980 - 2014$ would make our predictions go a lot slower as they were 34 potential categories($1980,1981\\ldots 2014$) for a prediction to be classified into.  Thus, we decided to group our year labels, going by a period of 4 years culminating into a final of 7 categories. While still not as fast as a simple binary classifier, our Linear Support Vector Classifier would finish training and classifying much faster than the original 34 categories."

    "Our best SVM model, trained on $2500000$ article headlines, was able to correct classify the approximate year about $38.658\\%$ of the time. This is significantly better than randomly selecting one of the possible seven options, $p_c = \\frac{1}{7}\\approx .14 $\n",
    "With 3.5 million headlines and a 38% accuracy, the results show that our approach of predicting a set of years based on a NY Times article headline is flawed and probably not a good one. Even with more optimizing of the bias variance tradeoff this model would not an accurate predictor of years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our expectations of the results were mixed. While we certainly did not think, they would a be a good predictor of years, we were surprised that the accuracy was greater than picking at random.  The results make sense to us. Seeing as how there are indeed news worthy event that would date the time of publication (our downfall of the Soviet Union example still holds), there are many more events that do not time a publication, for example news of shootings and stabbings are unfortunately common that they ended up being featured monthly regardless of the year.  Other newsworthy events span more than the period of time and were not encoded with distinctions, for example talk of a Clinton in politics could be found in the late 1990’s and around in the 2008 Democratic Primary but headlines don’t often specify if its Hillary Clinton or Bill Clinton.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As for new hypothesis generated by this assignment.  We wondered if instead of doing a supervised training model, an unsupervised model was applied to this data set. What type of cluster would be generated? This would be very interesting to see especially for old headlines, we would see where they would be clustered and if it would be similar to current sections of the NY Times (art, business, etc). Additionally, if unsupervised clustering was applied to all of our data, would the clusters be the same as the sections of the NY Times or what they show that there are actually more clusters and therefore more ways to classify articles currently . \n",

    "Overall this is was an insightful look into doing text analysis using the skills we learned from this course , and we are eager to put these skills into use for our final project."
